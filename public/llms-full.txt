# SMRY — Complete Documentation

> SMRY (smry.ai) is a free paywall bypass and article reader trusted by 300,000+ readers monthly.

## What is SMRY?

SMRY lets you paste any paywalled article link and get the full text plus an AI summary. No account required, no browser extension needed. It works with 1,000+ publications and is completely free to use.

## How It Works

SMRY fetches articles from 3 sources simultaneously to maximize success:

1. **Direct Access (smry-fast)** — Fetches the original URL directly with browser-like headers
2. **Premium Proxy (smry-slow)** — Uses intelligent article extraction via Diffbot API
3. **Wayback Machine** — Retrieves archived versions from archive.org

The first source to return complete content (500+ characters) wins. Other sources continue caching in the background. This parallel approach achieves a 76% success rate on major publications.

## Understanding Paywalls

### Soft Paywalls (SMRY works)
Content is loaded in the page but hidden by JavaScript overlays, popups, or CSS. Most major news sites use soft paywalls. The content is accessible to search engine crawlers for SEO purposes, which means tools like SMRY can also access it.

### Hard Paywalls (Cannot be bypassed)
Content is never sent to the client without authentication. No external tool can bypass these. Examples include Patreon, OnlyFans, and sites that verify subscription server-side before sending any content.

## FAQ

### How does paywall bypass work?
There are two types of paywalls: hard and soft. Hard paywalls don't expose content until you subscribe. Most sites use soft paywalls, where content is accessible but blocked by popups or only exposed to certain user agents. SMRY tries multiple methods in parallel: direct fetching, a proxy, and Wayback Machine archives.

### How do I know if content can be bypassed?
If a site shows content to search engines for SEO, it likely uses a soft paywall that can be bypassed. If some content is visible but part is obstructed, it's often a soft paywall. If no content is visible at all, it's likely a hard paywall.

### What sources does SMRY use?
SMRY tries 3 sources in parallel: direct fetching (smry-fast), a premium proxy (smry-slow), and Wayback Machine archives. The first successful result is returned immediately.

### Is SMRY open source?
Yes. Source code is available at https://github.com/mrmps/SMRY

### What languages are supported for summaries?
8 languages: English, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Chinese, and Japanese.

### Is there a rate limit?
Free tier: 20 articles/day, 6 per minute per IP. Pro: unlimited.

### Is this legal?
Yes. SMRY accesses publicly available content through legal methods. It does not store or redistribute copyrighted content.

### Does this work with all websites?
SMRY works with most sites using soft paywalls. Hard paywalls (Patreon, OnlyFans, login-gated content) cannot be bypassed by any tool.
