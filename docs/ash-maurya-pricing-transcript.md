# Ash Maurya: Business Model-Based Pricing

*Video Transcript - Lean Canvas Creator*

Pricing is one of the riskiest aspects of any business model but most Founders choose to defer pricing to later. They wait to first build their product, understand their cost structure, and then set pricing with customers. This is backwards. Your pricing model should determine your product and not the other way around. And the best time to set your pricing model is a lot sooner than you think. So in this video I'm going to show you how.

Hi there, if you're new to this channel my name is Ash Maurya. I'm an entrepreneur and author and the creator of the one-page business modeling tool Lean Canvas. On this channel I share systematic strategies and techniques for starting and growing a business.

## The Problem with "Free First"

A popular strategy when launching a new product is to give it away for free so that you can learn from users, get them to try before they buy, then set pricing based on what users would be willing to pay. While sound in theory, things seldom work this way in practice because:

### 1. Users are Different from Customers

While all customers start out as users, not all users go on to become customers. When you give away your product for free you will attract more users than customers who tend to drown out the true voice of your customer. It becomes harder to filter customer feedback that you should follow and instead you end up following the vocal majority which steers you down the wrong path.

### 2. Your Pricing Model is Part of Your Product

Next, your pricing model is very much part of your product and it determines which kind of customers you attract. Suppose I place two bottles of water in front of you and tell you that the one on the right costs 50 cents and the other costs $2. Even though you couldn't tell them apart in a blind taste test because they are similar enough, you might be inclined to believe or at least wonder if the more expensive water is of higher quality. Here price has the power to change your perception of the product.

Now more interestingly, the bottled water you pick also determines which customer segment you belong in. From the existing market for bottled water we know that there is a viable business model for bottled water at both price points. So what you charge signals your positioning on which customers you want to attract.

### 3. It's Not the User's Job to Set Pricing

And finally it is not the user's job to set pricing—that's your job because your business model and product survival depend on it. Can you imagine Steve Jobs asking customers what they'd be willing to pay for an iPhone or iPad?

## What NOT to Do: Cost-Based Pricing

In the next section I'll cover how to set pricing by first starting with what not to do.

First, you should completely forget cost-based pricing which is something a lot of people do by first determining their cost structure and then slapping a margin to set their price. This too is backwards because customers don't care about your solution or cost structure but rather their problems and outcomes.

When buying that iPhone, do you justify pricing by slapping a fair margin on Apple's unit costs? No, of course you don't. You justify pricing based on your perceived value of what the iPhone will let you do compared to other smartphones and more importantly how it makes you feel.

## Value-Based Pricing: Better, but Not Enough

Value-based pricing is another way of setting pricing and while it's certainly better than cost-based pricing, it's still not enough. In value-based pricing you anchor your pricing against your product's unique value proposition and the cost of similar alternatives. Your product's fair price sits somewhere between these two anchors.

Now this too isn't enough because it's possible to set a fair price for your product but still fail to build a viable business model and then you get stuck. This is why I recommend setting **business model-based pricing** before value-based pricing.

## Business Model-Based Pricing: The Three-Step Process

Setting business model-based pricing is a three-step process:

### Step 1: Outline All Ways to Achieve Your Business Model Goal

You want to avoid starting with your product or idea and instead determine that business model outcome based on your minimum success criteria that you would use to deem any project a success in 3 years.

Once you determine your minimum success criteria, the next step is to outline all the ways that you could achieve this outcome. For example, if my goal is to build a $1 million a year business there are really only five ways to accomplish this:

| Customers | Price Point |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1,000,000 | $1 |
| 100,000 | $10 |
| 10,000 | $100 |
| 1,000 | $1,000 |
| 100 | $10,000 |

Notice that this approach is idea agnostic—rather it's goal oriented. When you start thinking this way you quickly realize that there are only a finite number of ways to build any size of business.

### Step 2: Model Specific Business Model Variants

In the second step you begin to model specific business model variants that could meet that minimum success criteria goal of yours.

I'll illustrate this with a personal example. In 2010 I introduced the one-page business modeling template Lean Canvas in a blog post. Today the Lean Canvas is used by millions of people around the world. But going back in time, here are some of the ways I considered building a $1 million business around the Lean Canvas:

Some of these ideas are more feasible than others, while others are more fitting to the kind of company I wanted to build. Finding fit here is what I call **founder-model fit** and it's best to find this fit before pursuing product-market fit.

Here's how I prioritized my list of options for myself:

- **Selling 100,000 ebooks a year** may sound easy to some of you but most products like books convert at a very low percentage—1%. At scale this would require building a huge top of the funnel with 10 million people. While not impossible, it's certainly not easy.

- **High consulting fees and large consulting company**: My goal with my business was to prioritize impact and purpose over profit. While I could potentially charge high consulting fees and build a large consulting company, I didn't want to limit my expertise to just tens or hundreds of clients a year. These high-price options didn't fit my personal founder mission.

- **My last constraint** came from being a technical founder—I wanted to leverage software in some way versus just using people and time to build out the business.

This is how I ended up building an online Lean Canvas tool that grew into LeanStack.

### Step 3: Short List Your Most Promising Variants

The final step is to short-list your most promising variants by picking a big enough market that you want to serve. Now when you go through an exercise like this it's perfectly okay and even advisable to end up with a top one to three variant business models. It's a good idea to test these in parallel for a little while to find your one variant—your primary business model.

When you do, you want to stay razor focused on that and drive it to product-market fit.

## The Importance of Focus

Picking just one variant to focus on is probably the step that most founders struggle with—myself included—because it's so tempting to say yes to anyone who might want to pay you. But having five ways of making money at five different price points across different customer segments when you're pre-product-market fit is a recipe for spreading your limited resources too thin.

**Embracing a singular product, singular price point, and singular beachhead customer focus is vital until you hit product-market fit.**

## When to Apply This

So when do you apply business model-based pricing to your idea? The ideal time to apply it is at the outset of any new project.

The next best time is right now if you haven't already administered the rapid viability test on your product. This simple 5-minute exercise could save you months of wasted effort and drive a renewed focus on your beachhead customer, problem, and solution.
